# Simply-Love-PTBR

pt-BR translation of Simply Love SM5.

**Only supports [Simply-Love-Outfox](https://github.com/SheepyChris/Simply-Love-OutFox)**

This is an update to the already available pt-BR translation in Simply Love SM5, this has massive changes:

- Removed fallback from 5.1
    
    The old file had half or more of 5.1 fallback put inside the theme language file, this removes all fallback references since 5.3 already has fallback translated to pt-BR.
- Changed file name to pt-BR from pt-BR
    
    pt-BR is the Standard since the OutFox translation file is named "pt-BR".
- Applied translation methodology from Outfox translation.
