# Simply-Love-PTBR

pt-BR translation of Simply Love SM5

**Support for Simply Love 4.9 is in works. But, it only supports [Simply-Love-Outfox](https://github.com/SheepyChris/Simply-Love-OutFox)**

This is an update to the already available pt-BR translation in Simply Love SM5, this has massive changes:

- Removed fallback from 5.1
    
    The old file had half or more of 5.1 fallback put inside the theme language file, this removes all fallback references since 5.3 already has fallback translated to pt-BR.
- Changed file name to pt-BR from pt-BR
    
    For standard sake.
- Applied translation methodology from Outfox translation.

This is expected to enter SL SM5 when it supports 5.3
